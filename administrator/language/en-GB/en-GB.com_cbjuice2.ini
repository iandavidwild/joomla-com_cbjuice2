CBJ_ABOUT_STRING3="<br> CB-JUICE is an component for Joomla! that allows a site administrator to import users from a CSV text file. This version of CBJUICE expects the following format CSV file. <br></br> username,password,firstname,lastname,email <br></br> A HEADER LINE IS REQUIRED. Any additional CB profile variables may also be included. <b>USERNAME and primary EMAIL address MUST be unique</b> <br>"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING4="A confirmation email can be sent to the user [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] [USERNAME] and [CBJPASSWORD] are appropriately substituted in the message. The password is substituted only on add runs. The standard CONFIRMATION email can be sent from the registration interface as well by clearing the confirmation option in the settings. <br></br>"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING5="This version supports the USERTYPE variable and will manage the standard usertypes (publisher) available in JOOMLA etc in the USERS table. No support is provided for any non-standard tables or <b>any 3third party access products such as JACL or JUGA</b>."
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING6="In EDIT mode, the password is most usefully edited if it is stored externally and supplied as part of the update. In JOOMLA, the password is stored in an encrypted (HASHED) form. You MUST check the USE HASHED PASSWORDS option below to use such passwords. <b> This version now supports CB 1.3</b>"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING7="<b>Here are some of the features of CBJUICE<b><br /> <br /> <b>Configurable Delimiter Character</b><br></br> If your source application does not support comma delimited files you may choose the delimiter character at the time of import. Use 'TAB' for tab delimited files<br /> <b>Fills in gaps when Full Name or Email is missing</b><br></br>"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING8="In some cases your CSV may not contain the user's fullname or email address on an ADD run. CBJUICE will use the username for the name fields and generate an invalid email address when one is not supplied. The NAME field is generated from Firstname, Middle (if available) and last name.<br />"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING9="<b>Manage with email address or username</b><br> <p>This version allows the manager to apply edits on the basis of username or primary email address.</p> <br /> <b>Delete users by email or username</b><br></br>"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING10="If you manage your user database in another application besides Joomla! you may find this feature useful. You must supply a csv file with at least either the username or email address. <b>Consider the edit option first rather than delete and add.</b><br />"
CBJ_ABOUT_STRING11="<b>Proper handling of Joomla! ACLs</b><br></br> Importing and Deleting users from Joomla requires an application not only to deal with the users table but also the various ACL permissions tables of Joomla. CBJuice2.0 uses the CB API to make all that are required. <br></br>"
